# Spring2021TeamLighthouse
# Notes: from Glenn Guzman-Rockett
# -The individual Pages are built out as frames, that get pulled to front view 
#   when called by the buttons
# -As of right now(9:30am, 3/22/21) there are a LOT of placeholders for functionality
# -The original template used grid() to space everything, but pack() seems to accomplish
#   what we need
# -Looking into tkcalender to add scheduling for the scheduling screens
